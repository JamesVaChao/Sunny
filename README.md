COMP3004 project

Steps I used to install repo
1. Pulled the info from the repository
2. Navigated to the top level folder with "App.js" and ran the command "npm install" from the command line.
3. If you get an error about failing to load modules then delete the "node_module" folder and run "npm install" and then "npm cache clean --force"
4. If you still are getting error then it was probably the person who commited last who broke it.
